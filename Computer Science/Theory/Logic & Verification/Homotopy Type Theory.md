Homotopy [[Type theory]]: Programming and [[Verification]]

But now it looks like we might have a solution! Fields medallist
Vladimir Voevodsky has come up with a completely different take on the
problem by thinking of equalities as paths such as those which occur
in one of the most abstract branches of mathematics, namely homotopy
theory, leading to Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT). In HoTT, two objects
are completely interchangeable if they behave the same way. However,
most presentations of HoTT involve axioms which lack computational
justification and, as a result, we do not have programming languages
or verification systems based upon HoTT. The goal of our project is
to fix that, thereby develop the first of a new breed of HoTT-based
programming languages and verification systems, and develop case
studies which demonstrate the power of HoTT to programmers and
those interested in formal verification.
