From anecdotal experience, this is a simpler version of [[TLA+]] with capabilities for embedding C code into the models. Arguably, Promela also has simpler way to model [[communicating sequential processes]], such as channels in [[Go]] compared to TLA+.

Promela is used in the [[Spin]] model-checker.
