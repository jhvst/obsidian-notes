Costing parallel programs as a function of shapes

Portable, efficient, [[parallel programming]] requires cost models [[Resources Trading]] to compare different possible implementations. In turn, these require knowledge of the shapes of the data structures being used, as well as knowledge of the hardware parameters. This paper shows how shape analysis techniques developed in the [[FISh]] programming language could be exploited to produce a data parallel language with an accurate, portable cost model.
