Hilbert posed the question as to what were, in principle, the limitations of a scheme such as that of [[Principia Mathematica]].

Hilbert’s approach was called the formalist approach, because it treated mathematics as if a game, a matter of form.

First, was mathematics complete, in the technical sense that every statement (such as ‘every integer is the sum of four squares’) could either be proved, or disproved. [[Theorem provers]]

Second, was mathematics consistent, in the sense that the statement ‘2 + 2 = 5’ could never be arrived at by a sequence of valid steps of proof.  [[Consistency]]

And thirdly, was mathematics decidable? By this he meant, did there exist a definite method which could, in principle, be applied to any assertion, and which was guaranteed to produce a correct decision as to whether that assertion was true. [[Halting problem]]

[[Kurt Gödel]] had shown that formalised arithmetic must either be inconsistent, or incomplete.

The third of Hilbert’s questions still remained open, although it now had to be posed in terms of ‘provability’ rather than ‘truth’. Gödel’s results did not rule out the possibility that there was some way of distinguishing the provable from the non-provable statements.

[[Alan Turing]] addressed the third question: he had a way of representing a number like π, an infinite decimal, by a finite table. The same would be true of the square root of three, or the logarithm of seven – or any other number defined by some rule. Such numbers he called the ‘computable numbers’. They could be put in a list, or counted; and this meant that all the computable numbers could be put in a list. It was not a practical proposition actually to do it, but in principle the idea was perfectly definite, and would result in the square root of three being say 678th in order, or the logarithm of π being 9369th. It was a staggering thought, since this list would include every number that could be arrived at through arithmetical operations, finding roots of equations, and using mathematical functions like sines and logarithms – every number that could possibly arise in computational mathematics.

However, the point relevant to Alan Turing’s problem was that it showed how the rational could give rise to the irrational. In exactly the same way, therefore, the computable could give rise to the uncomputable, by means of a diagonal argument. As soon as he had made that observation, Alan could see that the answer to Hilbert’s question was ‘no’. There could exist no ‘definite method’ for solving all mathematical questions. For an uncomputable number would be an example of an unsolvable problem.
