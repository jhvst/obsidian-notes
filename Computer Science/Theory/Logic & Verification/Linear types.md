Abstract. Linear types provide a way to constrain programs by specifying that some values must be used exactly once. Recent work on graded
modal types augments and refines this notion, enabling fine-grained,
quantitative specification of data use in programs. The information provided by graded modal types appears to be useful for type-directed program synthesis, where these additional constraints can be used to prune
the search space of candidate programs. We explore one of the major
implementation challenges of a synthesis algorithm in this setting: how
does the synthesis algorithm efficiently ensure that resource constraints
are satisfied throughout program generation? We provide two solutions to
this resource management problem, adapting Hodas and Millerâ€™s inputoutput model of linear context management to a graded modal linear [[Type theory]]. We evaluate the performance of both approaches via their
implementation as a program synthesis tool for the programming language Granule, which provides linear and graded modal typing.
