The stack [[monoid]]
Sep 5, [[2020]]

(Updated 2020-09-06 with pointers to related work and a bit more explanation)

This is a bit of a followup to Towards [[GPGPU]] JSON parsing. That proposed a rather roundabout way to parallelize a simple parsing task. Having had more [[GPU]] programming experience under my belt, I donâ€™t expect that particular approach to work well, but it did suggest that parallelism exists in the problem. https://raphlinus.github.io/gpu/2020/09/05/stack-monoid.html [[parallel programming]]
