Event-B is based on refinement programming -- a type of programming where a language has a _context_ and a _machine_ which then model some functionality. The machines are then refined by other machines, which together prove mathematical properties of the system.

Anecdotally, Event-B is rather hard to program, but it does so by pure mathematical notation. For this reason, it's a very formal language, and might be useful in cases where the programmer wants to use "pure mathematics" to ensure [[reliance]] properties.
