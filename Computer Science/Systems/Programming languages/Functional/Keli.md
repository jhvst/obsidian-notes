A user from Quora asked: 
Why isn't functional programming that popular even though it's so beneficial?
One of the top answer says: 
The user experiences of [[functional programming]] languages sucks.
No doubt, this is a sad but true story for most functional programming  (FP) languages. I personally thought that FP languages like [[Haskell]] offers a very unified and pure programming concepts (i.e. everything are functions, and functions and compose well, etc). However, Haskell syntax is a mess (take a look at the grammar), there are a lot of edge cases (e.g. weird indentation rules). Of course this problem is not only limited to Haskell, similar problems can also be found in other FP languages like Erlang, F#, OCaml etc.  Thus, I believe that these are also the primal reason that most people felt FP languages are hard.  https://keli-language.gitbook.io/doc/
