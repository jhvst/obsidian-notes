Cubical [[Type theory]]: a constructive interpretation of
the univalence axiom∗

This paper presents a type theory in which it is possible to directly manipulate
n-dimensional cubes (points, lines, squares, cubes, etc.) based on an interpretation of
[[Dependent types]] in a cubical set model. This enables new ways to reason about
identity types, for instance, function extensionality is directly provable in the system.
Further, Voevodsky’s univalence axiom is provable in this system. We also explain an
extension with some higher inductive types like the circle and propositional truncation.
Finally we provide semantics for this [[cubical type theory]] in a constructive meta-theory https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02108
